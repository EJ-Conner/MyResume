# MyResume


This repository contains my resume written in LaTeX as well as the PDF version. Last updated on 03/20/2025.

Compiling the LaTeX File
You have two options to compile the LaTeX file (.tex) into a PDF:

Using Overleaf
Go to Overleaf.
Create a new project and upload the .tex file.
Overleaf will automatically compile the .tex file into a PDF that you can download.
Compiling Locally
Install a LaTeX distribution, such as TeX Live or MiKTeX.
Open your terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory containing the .tex file.
Run the command: pdflatex KyleEarpResume.tex.
This will generate a PDF file in the same directory.
